# Code-Quiz
## Description 
This [application](https://maeevee.github.io/Code-Quiz/) is a basic implementation of a quiz game. It uses the DOM to select and manipulate elements from the HTML file, and a function to display questions and answers. The quiz has three questions about JavaScript, and for each question, the user can select one of the given answers. The code uses an interval function to implement a timer, and it calculates the final score by adding 10 points for each correct answer and subtracting 5 seconds from the countdown for each incorrect answer. The score is displayed at the end of the game, and the user can submit their initials to save their score. The scores are saved in local storage.

## Installation
The code is meant to be executed in a special environment, such as a browser.

## Usage
This code is a simple quiz application. To use the code, you will need a web browser. The user will interact with the quiz by clicking the start button to initiate the quiz, selecting an answer from the multiple choice options, and submitting their initials to view their score. The quiz will have a 30-second countdown timer and will end either when the user answers all questions or when the time runs out. The user's score will be displayed at the end of the quiz:
